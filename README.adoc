= Dot files

Here you will find my dotfile (`~/.file`)
configurations.

Also, there are some very basic utilities
that I wrote in Bash, Python or other some
script languages.
Some of then are very tied to my environment so,
if you want to use this on your own,
you will have to adapt it to your needs.

To start using this repo it in your own
environment, you will need to clone this repo
and, after that run the `install` command:

----
$ git clone https://github.com/paulojeronimo/dotfiles
$ ./dotfiles/install
----

Do you want to remove these dotfiles from
your environment? ItÂ´s very simple! ðŸ˜ƒ
Only do this:

----
$ ./dotfiles/remove
----
