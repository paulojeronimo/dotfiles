Dot files (.file) with some configurations used in my notebook and employer's workstations (.pj-macbookpro, .capes-pj, .trf1-pj). This are very basic utilities written in Bash, Python or other some script languages. Most of then are very tied to my environment so, if you want use this in your own, you will have to adapt to your needs.

To start using it in you own enviroment, you will need to do:
```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/paulojeronimo/dotfiles.git 
$ ./dotfiles/install
```

Want remove? Very simple!! ;) Only do this:

```bash
$ ./dotfiles/remove
```
